## Student Interviews

{{< quote "Making the data ‘alive’ through non-quantitative means makes the concept much more relatable and personable. The audience understands this at an organic level, and they are drawn to learning more. It's much more engaging. Long story short, it is much more memorable. And in many cases, that's the entire point." "— Felipe Lozano-Landinez, Undergraduate" >}}

Below, students in the course describe the data storytelling techniques they found particularly compelling, offer advice to future students, and share tips with educators interested in facilitating a similar learning experience.
